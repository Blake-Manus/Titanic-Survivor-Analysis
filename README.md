# Titanic-Survivor-Analysis

* My first personal project (outside of the Iris Dataset) that I worked on while learning Data Science/Machine Learning to accurately predict who survived the historical event of the sinking of the Titanic. The current model provides an accuracy of 78.2%, which ranks ~82nd percentile in the Kaggle Competition.  The CSV output files and corresponding code are used to create accuracy checks on Kaggle.com.
