# Titanic-Survivor-Analysis

* My first project (outside of the Iris Dataset) that I am worked on while learning Data Science/Machine Learning to accurately predict who survived the historical event of the sinking of the Titanic. CSV Files printed within the code are meant to be submitted to Kaggle for grading of accuracy. The current most accurate method used is KNN.
